# About

Hi! I'm Alec. I'm a [cs](http://cs.uiuc.edu) student at [uiuc](http://uiuc.edu), planning on minoring in [math](http://math.uiuc.edu), and a former site reliability engineering intern at Google.

This is a blog I keep where I occasionally post cs, math, and programming related things, or just other random stuff happening in my life that others might care to know about.

I have somewhat strange political views. Growing up I was pretty liberal, but lately I've becoming more libertarian, and even more recently I've become interested in [Anarcho-capitalism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarcho-capitalism). But I don't talk about this much.
