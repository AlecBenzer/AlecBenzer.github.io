# About

Hi! I'm Alec. I'm a [cs](http://cs.uiuc.edu) student at [uiuc](http://uiuc.edu) minoring in [math](http://math.uiuc.edu), and a former/future site reliability engineering intern at [Google](http://www.google.com/about/company/).

This is a blog I keep where I occasionally post about cs, math, and programming related things, or just other random stuff happening in my life that others might care to know about.

Feel free to [say hi](mailto:alecbenzer@gmail.com).
