title: "Depression (a bit of an update)"

(This is a bit of an update of [this post](/blog/cycles), I guess.)

There was something I read about depression once that I wish I could find again -- it basically said that depression isn't really about sadness, but about weight.

Not in a "gaining weight" kind of sense or anything, but in the sense that you feel weighted down in everything you do. Everything feels like it requires much more effort than it should. Getting up, putting on clothes, taking a shower -- it all just takes way too much out of you to get done, in a mental and emotional sense. Mustering up the will to make your body go and do these things -- that's what's hard. The thing I remember reading had worded it better, but you get the idea.

Since hearing that I actually also saw part of a lecture about depression that described the technical names for the symptoms associated with it. The symptom that the "weight" person was referring to is, I think, [psychomotor retardation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychomotor_retardation). This is probably one of the most pronounced symptoms of depression I think I experience (probably tied closely with [anhedonia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anhedonia)).

This is what depression feels like for me most of the time. Not "sadness" or "misery" in a traditional sense, but debilitating lethargy and apathy.

Insofar as you could try to measure, objectively, how good a life is, I think I have a pretty good life. I'm interning at google for a second summer in a row, they pay pretty well, and my career prospects are (probably) generally good.

I go to a pretty good school. I got rejected from a bunch, but I think I've gotten over it. I get pretty good grades. I get pretty good grades without having to try _that_ hard. At least I think so. If I am trying hard, I guess I at least don't notice it.

Sure, my social life is kind of dull, especially romantically, and I'm not in the best shape, but that's nothing horrible and definitely nothing that couldn't be changed.

Nothing in my life is sad, really. But I still get "sad" sometimes, sad in the whole weighted-down sense. And I don't really know why. I guess that's kind of the point.

A few months after I wrote [that other post](/blog/cycles), I saw a psychiatrist, and she prescribed an anti-depressant. And you know, it really does help. Sometimes I begin to kind of doubt how much it helps and I try to stop taking it for a bit, and then I get reminded of how much it actually does help.

That makes it much easier to buy into the idea that this is just some kind of illness. I think a lot of people are hesitant to jump to that conclusion with depression. _Sadness isn't an illness._ When you're sad there's a reason. And even if you don't know what it is, you believe that there is _some_ reason, somewhere. And one day you'll figure it out and have some catharsis and it'll all make sense and you'll be all better.

But I don't know, I don't think there's something like that for me. I might wish there was, but the more I deal with this, the more I think that it just boils down to being a part of how my brain works that makes it hard to function normally.
