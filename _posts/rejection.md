In my hometown, very few people went to our public high school (which actually belonged to a neighboring town -- we didn't have our own high school). Almost everyone tried to get into some other high school. Most people went to Catholic schools. Some paid to go to other districts' public schools.Another option was applying for a local magnet school. That's what I did.

For reasons I can't completely remember, it was very important to my middle-school self that I get in to this high school. I started going to open houses two years in advance (when I was in 7th grade), I prepared a lot for the entrance exam, and awaited my results eagerly. And I got in! It was really great, for a while, at least.

After some time, though, the fact that I was going to the school started to become less and less important to me, at least in a "Wow, I actually got accepted to that place, I must be pretty smart" sense. One of my favorite Chuck Palahniuck quotes goes like this: "It's so hard to forget pain, but it's even harder to remember sweetness. We have no scar to show for happiness. We learn so little from peace." I guess it's just part of human nature to not care so much about good things that have already happened. Evolutionarily, I suppose it makes sense to look to the horizon and focus on the future, as opposed to resting on your laurels.

But for whatever reason, I was estatic for all of maybe a few hours after I got the acceptance letter in the mail, and then the excitement started to wan. Naturally, when I actually started attending next fall, the excitement resufraced again for a bit, and then wanned again.

That's not to say that I wasn't happy while I was there (not to say that I *was* happy, either). In hindsight I'm glad I ended up going to the high school I did. But what I didn't have was this sense that I was somehow special for having gotten in, or that people who attend the school were better than those that don't.I didn't have any kind of notion that somehow, the fact that I attended this school, in and of itself, would have any kind of a significant impact on the course of my future. I was still me, and even if I had gone to a different high school, I'd still be me.

So the bottom line is, after a while, I didn't care. I didn't care about getting in, I didn't care about not getting rejected, I didn't really care either way.

When it came time to go to college, I got to experience the opposite end of this whole situation. Long story short, I applied to 10 colleges, got in to 3, with 2 wait-lists.
