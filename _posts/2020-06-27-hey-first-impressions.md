[HEY](http://hey.com) is a new email service from Basecamp.

# Sender-based categorization

A central pillar of how HEY works is that all emails from a given sender get
categorized in the same way. This model allows for a much simpler UX than a
filter-based approach, but it does have issues: not all emails from a given
sender are neccesarily the same.

For example, one of the first emails I got using HEY was a promotional email
from JetBlue. I was attempted to just screen them out, but then I realized

# Design

I saw a few people on HN complaining about HEY's design, saying it felt
dated / "rails"-y.

I have no idea what they're talking about. I really like HEY's design.

# Imbox

Instead of an inbox hey as an ["imbox"](https://hey.com/features/the-imbox/)
for <em>im</em>portant, <em>im</em>mediate things. It's a pretty awkward
portmanteau, and it doesn't help that Basecamp is pretty cheeky about it
([itsnotatypo.com](http://itsnotatypo.com)). But I literally stopped
caring/notcing in about five seconds.
