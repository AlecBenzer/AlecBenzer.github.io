title: "Fonts make me <em>insane</em>"
---

I have a kind of OCD/mania thing when it comes to fonts and my blog.

If you look at my blog's commit history on github you'd probably find periods where like 90% of the commits are pretty much just font changes. It's gotten better now, but only because I try to not commit unless I'm actually adding/changing some content, not because I don't think about changing the fonts as often.

I don't know why. My blog isn't even that popular. And to the extent that it is, it's probably not because of the design. But I'm constantly just loading up my site, staring at the fonts for a few seconds, and telling myself "nope! nope nope nope. all wrong". And I change them.

Sometimes it's just brought on by seeing some fonts used nicely on another site. Like this morning, a few hours ago, I changed the fonts back from [Open Sans](http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Open+Sans) to [PT Serif](http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/PT+Serif). Then, I was browsing HN, saw [a page that I thought used Open Sans really well](http://internproject.io/choosing-an-internship/dont-take-your-highest-paying-offer/), kinda flipped out a bit, and now I've got my `style.scss` open in another vim buffer, trying to get Open Sans looking nice.

Now, to an extent, I guess this might just be my inner-designer seeing nice design and wanting to emulate it. But my reaction is just _way_ too intense, and it's something that I'm far too concerned with.

I try to tell myself that it doesn't matter. I try to tell myself that I should worry about content instead. I try to tell myself that should just be coding or doing other productive things. But it doesn't help.
