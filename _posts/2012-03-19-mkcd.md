I was getting tired of constantly doing stuff like:

{% highlight console %}
$ mkdir -p some/new/directory
$ cd some/new/directory
{% endhighlight %}

I was sure there'd be some command or option to just do it for me, but some googling didn't yield anything like that. Instead, I found [a link to this helpful little shell function](http://onethingwell.org/post/586977440/mkcd-improved):

{% highlight bash %}
mkcd () {
  mkdir -p "$*"
  cd "$*"
}
{% endhighlight %}

add it to your .bashrc and bam:

{% highlight console %}
$ mkcd some/new/directory
{% endhighlight %}

Plus, it's only one letter away from xkcd :)
