title: "Matt Taibbi on <em>Zero Dark Thirty</em>"
---

A few weeks ago I saw a link to [Matt Taibbi's article on _Zero Dark Thiry_](http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/blogs/taibblog/zero-dark-thirty-is-osama-bin-ladens-last-victory-over-america-20130116) called "'Zero Dark Thirty' Is Osama bin Laden's Last Victory Over America". I hadn't seen the movie so I didn't read the article at that time. I recently just watched it though, and went back to read the article, and I thought a lot of it was kind of silly.

If you haven't seen _Zero Dark Thirty_, go see it, it's good movie. One of the things that I thought was most striking about it was the character development that the protagonist, Maya, goes through.

In the very first scene of the movie, Maya's shown as being kind of taken aback as another character conducts a pretty brutal interrogation. As the movie goes on and Maya goes through more and more shit as she tries to find bin Laden, you see her slowly getting more and more obsessed with finding him, and even begins to see him as a personal adversary, especially after a friend of hers is killed by a suicide bomber. She survives suicide bombings and attempts on her life, and at the end of the movie she's transformed from this sort of reserved new-comer to much more of a badass CIA agent.

I didn't think this was a particularly deep observation; it seemed like a pretty major component of the movie. And I think it's pretty clear that Maya starts to move into some morally-gray areas as the movie progresses. She begins to become much more accepting of the torture that she was initially at least emotionally opposed to, and towards the very end she begins showing general disregard for people's lives. In the scene where she firsts meets the marine team that ends up killing bin Laden, for example, she explains how she wanted to bomb the entire complex where she suspected bin Laden was hiding, and she shrugs off one of the marine's concerns about putting the team at unnecessary risk.

I thought a lot of this was a big chunk of what made the movie good. And I think a lot of Taibbi's analysis ignored a lot of the depth of Maya's character. From the article:

> If Bigelow really means \[that depiction is not endorsement, that simply showing torture does not amount to publicly approving of it\], I have a rhetorical question for her: Are audiences not supposed to cheer at the end of the film, when we get bin Laden? ...is Maya a good character or a bad character?

_Really?_ "Is Maya a good or bad character"?

Maybe I've been spoiled by _A Song of Ice and Fire_, but I think that any story where you can have a reasonable expectation of classifying each character as "good" (in which case we should assume the author is endorsing whatever they do) or "bad" (in which case we should assume the author is condemning whatever they do) is a pretty crappy story. And this isn't at all a criticism I would levy against _Zero Dark Thirty_.

Does Taibbi think that during the scene where a suspected terrorist was being shoved into a tiny little box as a form of torture, that the audience was supposed to be think "Hm, yup, everything seems in order here". Does he think we weren't supposed to be kind of shocked? Does Taibbi think that we were supposed to be happy and cheering when the marines raiding bin Laden's complex just gun down some random baker and his wife, because they weren't sure who they were? That we weren't supposed to think it was kind of fucked up when a group of marines were trying to calm down some children whose parents they'd just killed?

Of course, I'm not saying the opposite of what Taibbi said is true; that the movie is actually about exposing the horrors of torture and other practices of our modern military. There _is_ a pretty significant sense of victory at the end of the movie.

But this doesn't mean that the movie's intended message was "USA #1!!", or that the movie must obviously be endorsing _everything_ that the protagonists do in it. Like, in my opinion, any good story, the protagonists weren't angels and the antagonists weren't demons. There was depth to the characters and depth to the conflict, and all of that made for a good story.

It seems ridiculous to think that all of that was just accidental, and that really Bigelow intended to endorse all the torture and other things that went on in the film.
