If someone tells you to do something because "it's the law", they're telling you that if you don't do it, people with guns will punish you. If the person talking to you is from the government, then they're threatening you.

There was an [r/Libertarian thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/1celpl/poster_at_my_high_school_proves_that_public/) about a poster at someone's school from the [US Selective Service System](http://www.sss.gov/default.htm) listing reasons people (well, men) should register for the selective service when they turn 18.

The reasons include

* "It keeps you eligible for a driver's license/college loans/gov't jobs."
* "Girls like guys... with jobs."
* "It only takes a couple of minutes."

But four of the ten reasons listed are variations of "it's the law". This is basically the US Selective Service System threatening you. I mean, yes, "it's the law" _is_ a pretty good reason to sign up for the selective service. But it's still a threat.

This is the case completely ignoring the morality/legitimacy of the selective service. If someone asks "Why shouldn't I murder?", an answer might be something like "it's immoral", or "would _you_ want to be murdered?" or something like that.

"It's the law" as an answer to that question, though, says nothing about whether murder is moral or not. Unless you believe that governments are the ultimate authority on morality, the _only_ thing "it's the law" says is that if you do murder someone, armed men will drag you to a prison and lock you up.

If women in certain Middle Eastern countries ask "why should I wear a burqa in public?", "it's the law" would be a totally legitimate answer. If someone asks me why I don't smoke pot, my answer would probably be (or include) something like "it's the law". I do not _at all_ mean by this that I agree with laws keeping pot illegal. I'm literally just saying "Policemen might lock me up if I smoke pot, and that's something I'd rather not risk".

It's like telling someone during WWII to hide the fact that they're Jewish, because otherwise the Nazis will drag them off and kill them. This is an _excellent_ reason to hide the fact that you're Jewish. But it has ***nothing*** to do with morality, doing what's "right", or anything like that.

So yeah, you should probably sign up for the selective service because it's the law. But don't confuse that with a statement about the justice or morality of the selective service.
