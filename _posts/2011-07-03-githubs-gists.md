title: Github Gists

You might have noticed that on some posts instead of zipping up the code to distribute it I make gists of them. Gists are a really cool way of quickly distributing code. You can create them by just copying and pasting code, and then for free you get:

* A git repo. All github gists are actually stored as full-fledged git repositories. You can clone them for an easy way to get the files onto your filesystem with one command, and you can even commit and push changes.
* A nice web view of the code. Clicking on a gist link takes you to a github page where all the files in the gist are printed and syntax-highlighted. You also get a revision history on the side for gists that have been edited.
* A tar.gz. If you prefer downloading and extracting a tar file to cloning a git repo, just add '/download' to the gist's url (or click on the pretty download button the web view has) to get access to a generated tar.gz file of the code. In fact, if all you wanted was a tar.gz in the first place, I think gists are an easier way to get one, especially if the code isn't already in files on your filesystem.
* Embedding. You can embed either the entire gist or any individual file from it via script tags that you can grab from the gist's web view.
