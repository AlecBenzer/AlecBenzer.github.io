title: New theme
---
Felt like my blog needed a redo, so I threw together a new theme. It's pretty heaviliy inspired by [James Yu's blog](http://www.jamesyu.org/), with help from [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) for [code snippets](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/base-css.html#code) and [wells](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/components.html#misc)

Look, in-line code snippets: `do_stuff` is the name of a function.

And code-blocks:

    100.times do |i|
      puts "#{i} is a pretty cool number"
    end

Or just ordinary wells:

<div class="well">Doesn't putting this text in a well make you more likely to read it?</div>

There's also tweet and plus one buttons now, so you can all tell your friends how awesome you think I am, and disqus comments, so you can tell me how much I suck.

Still using [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) with [github pages](http://pages.github.com) for hosting.
