It's been awhile since I've written anything personal, so I thought I'd give it a shot.

I just got back home from school and I'm going to start my internship in a week, so in general I'm probably not going to have to be thinking about school for awhile. So I'll think about it now.

My brother's going through all the college shit right now -- practicing for the SATs, getting ready to write applications, etc. And I absolutely _hate_ being reminded about this stuff, in a way I don't really hate anything else. It's not a “Oh, haha, I remember hating this when I was going through it. Sure glad I'm done with it now -- have fun with that!” kind of thing. No, I literally mean that I hate being reminded of this stuff, and that I hate having to think about it again.

The reason I hate thinking about all this stuff again is because of how much of a _monumental_ failure I feel it all was for me. I failed at applying to college (or getting into college, I guess) like I've never failed at anything else in my life.

Without going into too much detail, I had pretty strong numbers (save a 680 on the chem SAT II), flimsy convictions about where I wanted to go, some extra-curriculars that might've looked pretty good if the right people squinted hard enough (but that I didn't really care too much about), and, despite what I felt was a pretty strong passion for what I wanted to study, not all that much to show for it.

So, there were a bunch of places I wanted to get into that I didn't get into. Et cetera, et cetera. Call me whiny but thinking about all my rejection letters again kind of makes me sad, and I'd rather not be sad.

Because, see, I don't know -- being reminded of all this application stuff doesn't make me sad so much as it does angry and frustrated. As much as I might have wanted to get into the schools I didn't get into two years ago, the way things stand now, I'm pretty happy.

I'm not sure if I'd say I'm happy _with_ the school I ended up at, but I am definitely happy _at_ the school I ended up at. Ie, forgetting about the places I wanted to get into but didn't, just focusing on getting up every day, going to class, learning things interacting with friends and all that jazz -- I'm totally happy with that
