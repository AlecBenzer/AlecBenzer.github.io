I think the concept of property is frequently undervalued in discussions of politics.

To be clear, I'm talking about a _framework_ of property, a set of rules that determine how property works. Not about individual pieces of property as defined by a particular framework of property.

Some people insist that all business agreements are voluntary. Some insist that owning a factory is coercion. Some insist that society is entitled to some of the wealth of the rich. Some insist that they should be allowed to ingest whatever drugs they want. Some insist that their neighbors must keep their grass well-cut.

All of these are issues of differing views of property (or at least can be viewed as such). A framework of property is more or less just a set of rules about how things can be used and how you can prevent others from using things. The mantra ["property is theft"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property_is_theft!) makes very little sense in this context, since the entire concept of "theft" is contingent on framework of property (though those that say "property is theft" generally intend a different meaning for "property".)
