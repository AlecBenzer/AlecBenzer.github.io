title: "“You can always leave”"
---
A lot of people respond to Libertarians who complain 

Say Alice moves to a new city and starts a local business. After some initial success, a man comes into her store and says that he's from the mafia, and that Alice is required to pay the mafia a cut of her profits as protection money.

Upset, Alices talks to Bob, a fellow business-owner in the city. Bob explains that all businesses in the city pay a cut of their profits to the mafia, and it's just how things are done. Somewhat baffled by Bob's complacence, Alice asks Bob if he doesn't think the idea is unjust.

"I don't know", says Bob, "you can always leave and move your business to a different city."
