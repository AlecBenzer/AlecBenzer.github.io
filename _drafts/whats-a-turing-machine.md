title: What's a turing machine?
---
When you ask yourself what a computer is, you might just point to laptop or desktop or tablet or whatever you're using to read this website. If you're a bit more technically inclined, you might also think of things like microwaves, phones, calculators, and other electronic devices as computers.

But for the purposes of theoretical computer science, none of these definitions do us much of any god. To answer more fundamental questions about what computers are and what they can do, we need a much more mathematical model for what a computer is.

And so, that's what a turing machine is, more or less. While people might have built actual physical turing machines, the point of a turing machine is to provide a theoretical model for what a computer is, so that we can reason about them more easily.

Before we jump into what a turing machine is, it'll be useful to
