title: "Two kinds of feminism"
---

I'm not really sure if I'm a feminist or not -- mostly because from what I can tell there are two very different, almost opposite kinds of feminism.

The first kind of feminism seems to be about stopping gender from defining a woman (and to some extent any person). This is the kind of feminism that doesn't like to see women encouraged to not have careers because of their gender. It's the kind of feminism that just wants to mitigate the influence of gender roles.

My biggest qualm with this kind of feminism is that it's called "feminism" and not "gender egalitarianism". But other than that I think this kind of feminism is great.

Then there's this other kind of feminism that's very different. This kind of feminism seems to want to reinforce (certain) women's gender roles.

For example -- one of the views I associate with this second kind of feminism is the desire to have a very broad definition of rape....
