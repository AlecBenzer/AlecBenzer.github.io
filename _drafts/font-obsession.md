I'm kind of obsessed with fonts.

It's a bit of a problem. I know having a nice, comfortable editing environement is important, but I think I take it too far. I'll open a few terminals and gvim in i3 to get ready to work on a lab, work on it for about two seconds (not kidding here), get slightly annoyed by vim's or my terminal's font, and go on a 30-minute hunt for something I'm more comfortable with.
