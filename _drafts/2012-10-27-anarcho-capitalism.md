title: 'Anarcho-Capitalism &amp; Voluntaryism'
---
My political views are pretty out-there. When I was younger I was a pretty text-book liberal (well, when I was _even_ younger, I was kind of a religious nut, or at least as much of a religious nut as a sixth-grader could be), but lately I've been finding myself becoming more and more (right-)libertarian.

Even more recently, though, I've been opening up to what I guess most would consider an extremist libertarian philosophy: [anarcho-capitalism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarcho-capitalism) (although I much prefer the term [voluntaryism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntaryism)).

Voluntaryism is basically just the idea that all human interaction should be voluntary. For the most part this isn't all that controversial. Examples of **in**voluntary interaction between humans are things like theft, rape, murder, and these are things that most of modern society condemns and views as wrong.

However, a notable example of something that most of modern society is okay with, but that voluntaryists are not, is the operation of most modern governments. Taxation, for instance, is considered an example involuntary interaction by most voluntaryists. For this reason, voluntaryists are against the existence of (most kinds) of governments, and believe that society can and should operate without such governments (hence the "anarcho" in "anarcho-capitalist").

Now, if you're hearing about voluntaryism for the first time, and if you're like most people (including me, initially), you probably think that both parts of that claim (that society _should_ operate without governments, and also that it _can_) are pretty ridiculous. But I don't think they are.

In terms of the feasibility of an anarcho-capitalistic/voluntaryist system, I'd direct you to [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTYkdEU_B4o), narrated by [David Friedman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_D._Friedman), explaining at a high level how things like law and justice would work without a central government acting as a monopoly for such things.

But in terms of just the moral implications of such a system, or, seen another way, the moral issues of our current system, consider this: a mafia cell and a government are fundamentally very similar entities.

Most people would agree that a mafia is a pretty fundamentally illegitimate and immoral thing. Some mafia does not have the right to take your money away from you. Are there ways to avoid a mafia? Sure. For one thing, you could leave the mafia's area of operation (of course, you might end up in a different mafia's area of operation). But this doesn't make the mafia's actions any more legitimate.

When _does_ a mafia become legitimate? What if the mafia came to your business and took your money, but offered to allow you to come to their head-quarters once a year, where you could vote on who the next don will be. What if they told you that there already was a vote, and that it was decided that your money should go to the mafia? Is the mafia allowed to take money from you now?

What if the mafia decided to start a postal service with the money it takes from you? Is it entitled to your money now? What if it starts developing and issuing its own currency?

What if the mafia tells you that it needs money from you so that it can protect you? _Now_ is the mafia allowed to take your money, regardless of whether or not you want to give it up?

Piece by piece, we could see how a mafia could transition into behaving more like a government. But I don't think that at any of these steps, the mafia all of a sudden becomes entitled to your money.
