title: "My Favorite Scene from <em>The Dark Knight</em>"
---

I'm not that big on super-hero movies, nor I am that much of a Batman fan, but _The Dark Knight_ was still one of my favorite movies, pretty much solely because I think TDK's Joker is probably my favorite villain from any movie ever.

Honestly, without The Joker, I think TDK is kind of a mediocre film. The rest of the acting is alright, I'm not such a fan of some of the music choices, and the story sometimes seems like it's jumping around a little too much for my taste. All of that stuff isn't _bad_, I just didn't think it was that good. But The Joker was.

But so anyway, my favorite scene in the movie is the "Joker crashing the dinner party" scene, pretty much only because of The Joker's second "You wanna know how I got these scars?" speech. The first time we hear that speech is right before The Joker kills Gambol. The speech goes something like this:

> My father was a drinker, and a fiend. And one night he goes off crazier than usual. Mommy gets the kitchen knife to defend herself. He doesn't like that -- not one bit. So, me watching, he takes the knife to her, laughing while he does it. He turns to me, and he says "Why so serious serious, son?" He comes at me with the knife. "Why so serious?" He puts the blade in my mouth. "Let's put a smile on that face".

I feel kind of bad writing that out because of how little justice it does Ledger's performance. But anyway, so that's the first speech. Presumably, at this point, the audience thinks that this why The Joker is so crazy; that he had a messed up childhood and witnessed his father kill his mother only to then mutilate him. Who wouldn't that fuck up? It's also got the dad laughing as he kills the mom, explaining the choice of persona for The Joker, and we've got a nice little believable villain origin story. 

But then we get to the second speech. It goes like this:

> I had a wife, _beautiful_, like you, who says I worry too much, who says I should smile more. Who gambles, and gets in deep with the sharks. One day they carve her face. Now we've got no money for surgery. She can't take it. I just want to see her smile again. I just want her to know I don't care about the scars. So, I take a razor blade, and do this to myself. And you know what? She can't stand the sight of me. She leaves. Now I see the funny side -- now I'm always smiling.

Now, to the people hearing this speech, again, we've got a nice little background story. His wife got mutilated, but he still loved her anyway, so to try and make her happy again he made himself like her, only to find that she wasn't okay with the scars on him like he was on her. Tragic story. Could totally make someone go off the deep end. This is presumably what everyone at the party who hears this speech is thinking.

But the audience, the only people that heard both the first speech and this one, they're going "oh, shiiiiit....". _He's just making shit up_.

## So why is this my favorite scene?

(Slight melodrama warning.) This is my favorite scene because it sets up The Joker's character as a force for mocking society's views on insanity and trauma.

The Joker's two stories, independently, are believable explanations as to why he is the way he is. Something horrible and traumatic happened in his life, and now he's messed up because of it. While we don't really know much about The Joker's actual past, I think it's safe to assume that nothing all that traumatic actually happened to him. That's the point. The message is that something extraordinarily horrific or traumatic doesn't need to happen for you to go insane.
