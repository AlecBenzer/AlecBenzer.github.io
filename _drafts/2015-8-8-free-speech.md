As many are quick to point out, people often misunderstand what the right the
free speech means, and what exactly the first amendment does for citizens. As
a recent xkcd explains:

![](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/free_speech.png)

> The right to free speech means the government can't arrest you for what you
> say. It doesn't mean that anyone **else** has to listen to your bullshit, or
> host you while you share it. The first amendment doesn't shield you from
> criticism or consequences. If you're yelled at, boycotted, have your show
> canceled, or get banned from an internet community, your free speech rights
> aren't being violated. It's just that the people listening think you're an
> asshole, and they're showing you the door.

And this is completely accurate. One's *right* to free speech has to do
primary with the government, and what kinds of things can legitimately be done
to do you from a legal standpoint based on the things you say (basically,
nothing that couldn't already be legitimately done to you before).

But the *concept* of free speech in general is a little broader. The underlying
concept here is that we should not silence people based on the things that they
say. And while it's probably most important that this apply in a legal sense,
I think it should also apply, more loosely, in a general, social sense.

And this entire concept is something the comic kind of implicitly dismisses (or
maybe fails to acknowledge the existence of).

One of the best defenses of free speech I've heard is this one by Christopher
Hitchens:

What I think is the most relevant excerpt:

> [A holocaust denier] doesn't just have a right to speak -- that person's
> right to speak must be given extra protection. Because what he has to say
> must have taken him some effort to come up with, might contain a grain of
> historical truth, might in any case get people to think about why do they
> know what they already think they know. "How do I know that I know this,
> except that I've always been taught this and never heard anything else?" It's
> always worth establishing first principles, it's always worth saying "What
> would you do if you met a flat earth society member? Come to think of it, how
> can I prove the earth is round? Am I sure about the theory of evolution?
> I know it's supposed to be true -- here's someone who says there's no such
> thing, it's all intelligent design. How sure am I of my own views?" **Don't
> take refuge in the false security of consensus, and the feeling that whatever
> you think, you're bound to be okay, because you're in the safely moral
> majority.**

It's not super clear whether Hitchens is talking about a legal right to free
speech or about free speech in general, but I think that part is definitely
making a strong argument for why there is real value in what I'll call *social*
free speech -- in not demonizing or ostracizing people based on their views.

By shutting out people whose views you feel repulsed by, you buy yourself some
peace of mind, and maybe some points with a group of people that thinks
similarly, but not much else.

On the other hand, you lose the chance to examine your own views. You become
more ingrained in them -- which makes it all the more likely that you begin to
hold them not because you think they're true but because you want them to be
true. You also push whoever you are shutting out even further away from your
own viewpoint, deeper into their own camp.
