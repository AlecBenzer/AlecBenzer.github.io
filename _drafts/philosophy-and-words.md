title: Philosophy and definitions
---

During my semester of PHIL 101, I've found myself becoming frustrated by what seems to be a common theme in our discussions: people taking definitions of things for granted.

Maybe I'm just being taught this stuff kind of poorly, but it seems like so many debates in things like philosophy of existence and moral philosophy revolve around talking past each other when it comes to definitions.

Eliminativists argue that nothing exists but atoms. Conservatists argue that the only things that exist are things that are commonly thought to exist. But both of those positions are are not purporting to be using an established definition of existence -- they are proposing a definition of existence.

I might suggest that the only things that exist are purple pumpkins. This sounds absurd, but as long as I'm just _defining_ what I mean by existence instead of taking an accepted definition and making a claim, there's nothing logically wrong about my theory of existence. The only issue with it is that it goes against most people's intuitions about what the word "existence" means.

You can _only_ argue about which account of existence is "correct" if you have a definition to work with. Otherwise, you're attempting to argue about a word that has no established meaning.

I'm not trying to say that a theory of existence is only as good as it is intuitive to people -- it may be that less intuitive accounts of existence are actually better at describing what we think of when we say "existence". What I'm saying is that such debates are fundamentally about _language_, not about the nature of the world.

Similar issues seem to come up in moral philosophy. Deontologists and utilitarians disagree about what is "moral", but they do not share a common definition of the word "moral", so debates between them seem somewhat meaningless.

What's the moral thing to do in the trolley problem? Stop! Before you can even attempt to answer that question you need to understand what the word "moral" means. And so when deontologists and utilitarians give different answers, it is _not_ that they are giving opposing answers to the same question -- it's that they are answering two _different_ questions, corresponding to their respective definitions of the word "moral".

In moral philosophy the problem seems easier to resolve, though. Instead of asking "what's the moral thing to do?", we can ask "what _should_ we do?" Here there is less ambiguity. Deontologists and utilitarians can likely agree on what "do" means, and also on what "should" means (though perhaps that part is slightly harder). Deontologists and utlitarians can agree on what the deontological thing to do in the trolley problem is, and also on what the utilitarian thing to do this, but they disagree on which of these two things an agent _ought_ to do.
