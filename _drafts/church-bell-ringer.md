title: "The Illiterate Bell Ringer"
---

_This is a story a family member told me once. I'm sure they didn't come up with it, but I'm not sure where it came from._

There once was a man named John, who worked as a bell ringer at a local church. Though he was diligent and good at his job, he could not read or write, though these skills weren't particularly necessary for a bell ringer's duties.

One day, in an effort to promote literacy, the Church decided that all Church employees had to be able to read and write. So, one day at work, John was let go.

Depressed, John felt like having a smoke. So he began wandering around the city looking for a smoke shop. But he quickly noticed that there were none nearby. So he kept walking, and walking, but still found no smoke shops. By the time he finally did find one, he had been walking for over half an hour.

This struck John as odd, as he thought there would be demand for a smoke shop in the part of town closer to the church. John then got an idea to open his own smoke shop in that part of town.

And so, with a loan, John put together a small stand, bought some pipes and tobacco, and set up shop in the courtyard just outside the church. As he had anticipated, there was much demand for a smoke shop there, and business went well. After a few months, he had been able to pay back his loan and had quite a lot of money left over.

For a while, John enjoyed the luxuries he could now afford that were unavailable to him on a bell-ringer's salary. But then he decided he wanted to expand his business. So he used some of the leftover money to buy an actual store nearby. He abandoned his cart, and moved into the store.

Business got even better, and John found he had even more money on his hands. So, looking to expand even more, John looked into buying a second a shop, and hiring someone to run it for him. To do this required more elaborate paperwork, and notably required John's signature on certain documents. But John could not read or write, so he simply signed his documents with an "X".

John was apparently very skilled at the smoke shop business. His stores kept doing better and better, and he kept expanding more and more, until he became the owner of smoke shops all over the city. And of course, there was always more paperwork to sign, and always John would sign with an "X".

One day, a patron noticed this, and asked John if he was illiterate. When John said that he indeed was, the patron was shocked. "You can't even read or write, and yet you're the owner of the largest smoke shop chains in the city? That's amazing! Imagine where you'd be if you _did_ know how to read and write!"

"I know exactly where I'd be", John replied. "I'd be the church bell-ringer."
