title: “Creating money” and what banks do
---

*\me puts on novice economist hat*

People often say that "banks create money by giving out loans". The more I think about it, the more I don't really like this explanation of what loans do.

If I have <span>$100,000</span> saved up, I could give a friend of mine a <span>$50,000</span> loan for. In doing so, I woudln't really say I've "created money"; all I've done is take <span>$50,000</span> that I was saving and invested it (assuming I'm expecting interest on the loan) by lending it to a friend, which he can now go and spend on things.

Of course, if I were to do this at all, it would mean I'm okay with only having <span>$50,000</span> in savings. But what if I wasn't? If I only felt safe having at least <span>$100,000</span> in savings, I wouldn't have lent my friend the <span>$50,000</span>.

But what if my money were in a bank, instead? If I deposit my money into a bank, the bank's likely going to keep some minimum required reserve, and then use the rest of the money to give out loans. Maybe they'll even use some of my money to give a <span>$50,000</span> loan to my friend.

And I'm totally fine with this. That is, I'm totally fine with the fact that my savings are actually going to be lent out to people.

In fact, in another sense, I've actually lent _most_ of my money (except the minimum required reserve) to the bank itself. So where before I was unwilling to lend <span>$50,000</span> to a friend, I've now lent (assuming a required reserve rate of 10%) <em>$90,000</em> to a bank.

## Why am I fine with any of this?

Because I trust the bank in ways I don't trust my friend.

When I lend money to a friend, it's pretty definitively no longer in my posession. While my friend does owe me the money back, I can't reasonably ask for it back whenever I want.

It's different with a bank. A bank has enough customers and therefore enough cash on hand that it's able to pay back any amount of money I've lent it whenever I want ([probably](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression)).

So even though I'm technically lending more money to a bank than I would have to a friend, because of the terms of my loan with the bank (and my confidence that the bank can honor those terms), I feel safer considering the lent money as "saved".

Banks enable the spending of money that would otherwise be sitting as savings.
