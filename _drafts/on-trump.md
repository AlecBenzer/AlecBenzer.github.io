title: "On Trump"
---

I don't really know what to think about Trump's campaign. Of all the candidates
that have run, I probably disagree the most with Trump: He supports trade
protectionism and restricted immigration. He sides with the FBI on the Apple
encryption case. He supports eminent domain. He's in general very
nationalistic. Even just based on his personality: he's narcissistic, he seems
to have a very fragile ego, he seems to exclusively resort to name calling when
he or his positions are attacked.

And yet, I feel like despite all this, how strongly people demonize Trump is sort of surprising.

I mean, even though I disagree with almost all his policy suggestions, I don't
think any of them are particularly insane. Nationalism is a thing, it appeals
to lots of people. Tons of people believe in controlling borders and in eminent
domain.
