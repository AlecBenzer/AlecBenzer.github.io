title: "Half-drunken ramblings on “The Red Wedding” and the ending of <em>Game of Thrones</em>’ third season"
---

This post is primarily directed at any _Game of Thrones_ watchers who haven't also read the books, and are somewhat upset at how season 3 of the show ended. Though it likely goes without saying, spoiler alerts through season 3. I also talk _about_ some things that happen later, without really mentioning what they are, but if you feel like you might consider that a spoiler then you should probably leave. Also, warning: I'm slightly drunk, a little upset, and putting on my srs bsns hat.

So, in case you didn't know, while the first two seasons of the show covered the first and second books (roughly) respectively, the third season covered only the _first half_ of the third book, _A Storm of Swords_. This, while perhaps a neccesary move in terms of the amount of events in the book, significantly changes (in my opinion) the dynamic of the way the story is told to you.

The Red Wedding was completely shocking and saddening, probably more so than any event in the series to date. But in the books, it wasn't the _end_ to anything. It's actually sort of completely the opposite -- it was the first in a whole _bunch_ of exciting events that take place throughout the second half of _A Storm of Swords_.

And I think there's good reason for this. Obviously I can't see into GRRM's mind, but I'm pretty sure it would have been bad story-telling to stick the Red Wedding at the _end_ a book. And completely regardless of whether or not it would've been good story-telling, it's just _not_ what GRRM did. Ned's death, for example, was stuck pretty much at the end of _A Game of Thrones_, but The Red Wedding was a somewhat different, more complete defeat than Ned's death was. GRRM could have done something similar with it, but he didn't: the segment of the _A Song of Ice and Fire_ storyline that contained the Red Wedding did not close with it.

But, I mean, what are the show-writers going to do? The seasons are stuck at ten episodes, and they didn't want to rush the events of the first half of the book. Well, there was a particular event that occurs as the very last scene of _A Storm of Swords_ that's definitely at least on-par with the Red Wedding in terms of shock (and, in my opinion, a bit more shocking), but is not really a "sad" scene. People react differently to it, but I personally think it was an amazingly awesome scene, and that it totally offers some closure for the Red Wedding.

More importantly, though, this scene's placement at the end of the book has nothing to do with the timeline of events. That is, lots of things happen in the second half of the book, but this particular scene does not reference any of them, and could have made sense, timeline-wise, much earlier. It was placed at the end of the book (again, I can't read GRRM's mind, but making an educated guess here) because GRRM wanted the impact and shock of that event to come at the ending of a book.

So, what a lot of people thought was going to be done, was that the show-writers were going to move this scene up, and use it as the final scene of season 3. They did not do this.

In this sense, I think the experience the show conveyed with respect to the Red Wedding was not really consistent with the overall experience that the books conveyed, when it very well could have been. Being faithful to the chronology of events is, in my opinion, less important than being faithful to the _feeling_ that the book conveyed.

So, to just tl;dr all that stuff above, I respectfully think the show-writers made a mistake in their choice to not include this scene in season 3. It would have cushioned the blow from The Red Wedding, instead of basically ending this segment of the story with it, completely unlike what the books did.

That being the case, I have three suggestions for people:

1. Grit your teeth and wait until next season. Stuff might kind of suck now, but it gets better (sort of). The second-half of _A Storm of Swords_ is a wild fucking ride, and season 4 should really be awesome.

2. ***Read the books.*** Seriously. In retrospect maybe this should have been option 1. Read the books. Go now. Seriously. [Here's the amazon link for the first book](http://www.amazon.com/Game-Thrones-Song-Fire-Book/dp/0553386794/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1370838508&sr=8-1&keywords=A+Game+of+Thrones). [Or better yet, pay twice as much and get the first four books](http://www.amazon.com/Books-Thrones-Feast-Crows-Swords/dp/0345529057/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1370838508&sr=8-2&keywords=A+Game+of+Thrones). Or maybe you're fancy and have a kindle. Or maybe you hate amazon, fine, whatever, buy them somewhere else. But seriously, they're great. "Meh, but I don't like reading." No. Stop. I couldn't tell you the last book I read before _A Game of Thrones_. I was never a big reader. It doesn't matter -- go read them, they're awesome. I recently finished the fifth book and now I need to go find more books to read. So yeah, in summary, go read the books. _Seriously_ consider this option before moving on to option 3.

3. I'm going to go ahead and tell you to read option 2 one more time. I know you just read it, but I don't care, read it over again. _Still_ here? Okay, well, if you're upset at how lame the ending of the season felt and you're upset that everyone's dead and everything sucks and fuck this show I hate this and whatever else, and you're really, really, _really_ sure you don't want to go with option 2, I'm going to first tell you one last time that you're probably wrong and you should read option 2 again. Then I'm going to hesitantly make the fairly controversial suggestion that you **read the epilogue of _A Storm of Swords_**, if you can get your hands on it.

To some that might seem almost as bad as just googling spoilers (which you should **ABSOLUTELY** not do -- if you're even thinking about that then just read the epilogue instead), and I could be totally off-base here, but I don't think it's _such_ a crazy idea. The events that the epilogue are built upon have all already been covered in the show with sufficient accuracy. It sounds crazy, but really I think the only issue with it is that you'd be making a sudden "transfer of medium".

Like, can you imagine reading a book, and then all of a sudden one chapter's missing and a bunch of people come into your room and act it out for you, and then you go back and the book picks up from there?

That'd be weird.

And so it'd be weird to be randomly thrust into GRRM-land and his writing style and everything else about his books as a medium for expressing the story just for this one scene. And that's a very good reason to [**read the books from the beginning**](http://www.amazon.com/Game-Thrones-Song-Fire-Book/dp/0553386794/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1370838508&sr=8-1&keywords=A+Game+of+Thrones) instead. But, if you're _really_ sure you're not going to do that, then reading the epilogue might not be a completely insane suggestion.

Whatever you do, I hope you continue to enjoy _A Song of Ice and Fire_ one way or another. It gets better. The North remembers.

P.S.: [read the books](http://www.amazon.com/Game-Thrones-Song-Fire-Book/dp/0553386794/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1370838508&sr=8-1&keywords=A+Game+of+Thrones)
